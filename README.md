## Project 2  
Your team will develop a software that behaves like a bank teller to process banking transactions. This project uses
the IDE console as the user interface and utilizes the Java standard input and output to read the transactions and write
the results. The transactions may include, open a new account, close an existing account, deposit money to an existing
account, withdraw money from an existing account, and print the account details. The software system maintains an
account database, which may include 4 different types of bank accounts listed in the table below. Same person can
hold different types of accounts. The interest rates and fee schedules are different based on the account types and
account options.

## Project 3
You will revamp the user interface for the software you developed in Project 2, to develop a GUI (graphical user
interface) with JavaFX. The GUI shall replace the BankTeller class in Project 2 and handle the banking transactions
entered by the user. The GUI version must meet ALL the functional requirements stated in Project 2 description.
