## Project 2  
Your team will develop a software that behaves like a bank teller to process banking transactions. This project uses
the IDE console as the user interface and utilizes the Java standard input and output to read the transactions and write
the results. The transactions may include, open a new account, close an existing account, deposit money to an existing
account, withdraw money from an existing account, and print the account details. The software system maintains an
account database, which may include 4 different types of bank accounts listed in the table below. Same person can
hold different types of accounts. The interest rates and fee schedules are different based on the account types and
account options.

## Project 3
You will revamp the user interface for the software you developed in Project 2, to develop a GUI (graphical user
interface) with JavaFX. The GUI shall replace the BankTeller class in Project 2 and handle the banking transactions
entered by the user. The GUI version must meet ALL the functional requirements stated in Project 2 description.

## Project 4
RU Café sells donuts and coffee. Your team will develop a software for the Café to manage the orders. Your team
must use JavaFX to develop the GUIs for taking the orders, placing the orders and cancelling the orders. The store
manager will be the user who uses the software. The menu items include:

• Three different types of donuts: yeast donut, cake donut and donut holes. Each type of donuts includes a variety
of flavors. Regardless of the flavors, a yeast donut is $1.59, a cake donut is $1.79, and a donut hole is $0.39.

• Brewed coffee, with the choices of different add-ins: cream, syrup, milk, caramel, and whipped cream; and, with
the choices of different cup sizes: Short, Tall, Grande and Venti. The price for a Short black coffee is $1.69. Each
add-in costs $0.30. The price increase for the next size is $0.40. For example, the price increase for a Grande is
$0.80, therefore a Grande black coffee is $2.49, and a Grande coffee with cream and syrup would be $3.09.

## Project 5
Develop an Android app based on the requirements of Project 4. You must meet all the functional requirements stated
in Project 4 description, excluding the Export of store orders.
